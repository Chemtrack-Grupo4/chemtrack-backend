# ðŸ”¬ ChemTrack â€“ Backend API

This is the official **backend service** for the ChemTrack platform â€” a solution for managing and monitoring chemical inventories in laboratories, academic institutions, and industrial environments.

It provides a secure, RESTful API for the ChemTrack Web and Mobile apps to interact with the database, manage users, chemicals, safety data sheets, and logs of chemical handling.
